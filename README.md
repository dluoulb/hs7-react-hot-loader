# react-hot-loader

This is a **highly experimental** proof of concept of [React live code editing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw4fKkyPPg8).  
It marries React with Webpack [Hot Module Replacement](http://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html) by monkeypatching `React.createClass`.  

Inspired by [react-proxy-loader](https://github.com/webpack/react-proxy-loader).

### Running Example

```
npm install
cd example
webpack-dev-server --hot
open http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/bundle
```

Then edit `example/a.jsx` and `example/b.jsx`.  
Your changes should be displayed live, without unmounting components or destroying their state.

### Limitations

* You have to include component's displayName in `require` call

### Implementation Notes

Currently, it keeps a list of mounted instances and updates their prototypes when an update comes in.  
A better approach may be to make monkeypatch `createClass` to return a proxy object [as suggested by Pete Hunt](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/341#issuecomment-48372300):

## Installation

`npm install react-hot-loader`

## Usage

[Documentation: Using loaders](http://webpack.github.io/docs/using-loaders.html)

```javascript
// Currently you have to pass displayName to require call:
var Button = require('react-hot?Button!./button');
```

When a component is imported that way, changes to its code should be applied **without unmounting it or losing its state**.
