react-hot
=========

This is a generic library implementing hot reload for React components without unmounting or losing their state.

It is used by [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) but not tied to Webpack itself, so alternative build systems that support incremental updates can use it to implement [live-reload for React components](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/).
