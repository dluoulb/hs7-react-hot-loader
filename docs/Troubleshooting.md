### Cannot resolve 'file' or 'directory' `react/lib/ReactMount`

If you're using a precompiled React instead of `react` npm package, React Hot Loader configuration will need a few tweaks. See [Usage with External React](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/README.md#usage-with-external-react).

Make sure you have `'.js'` in `resolve.extensions` section of Webpack config, of Webpack won't be able to find any JS files without explicitlu specifying extension in `require`.

### My bundle is so large!

Make sure you have separate configs for development and production. You don't need `react-hot` in `loaders` or `webpack-dev-server/client` or `webpack/hot/only-dev-server` in production config. They are only for development. For easier maintenance, you can set an environment variable before invoking Webpack and read it in config.

Also make sure you have these plugins in production config:

```js
// removes a lot of debugging code in React
new webpack.DefinePlugin({
  'process.env': {
    'NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production')
  }
}),
// keeps hashes consistent between compilations
new webpack.optimize.OccurenceOrderPlugin(),
// minifies your code
new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({
  compressor: {
    warnings: false
  }
})
```
